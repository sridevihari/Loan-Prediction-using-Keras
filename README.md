# Deep-Learning
Steps to build a Neural Network using Keras
1. Loading the dataset
2. Creating training and validation set
3. Defining the architecture of the model
4. Compiling the model (defining loss function, optimizer)
5. Training the model
6. Evaluating model performance on training and validation set
